// In this assignment, you will need to work through each of the steps and figure out what the value of the variable equals each 
// step of the way. Once you have worked out what the value is at each step, send an email to your instructor letting us

//variable created:
// var x = 3;

//step 1, what does x after the changes in the code below?
// x = x + x

//step 2, what does x after the changes in the code below?
// for(var i = 0; i < 4; i++){
// x = x + 1
// }

//step 3, what does x after the changes in the code below?
// if(x > 10){
// x = 2;
// } else {
// x = 3;
// }

//step 4, what does x after the changes in the code below?
// function doubleIt(value){
// return value*2;
// }

// doubleIt(x);
// x = doubleIt(x);

//step 5, what does x after the changes in the code below?
// var numberArray = [1,2,3];

// for(i = 0; i < numberArray.length; i++){
// x = x + numberArray[i];
// }
