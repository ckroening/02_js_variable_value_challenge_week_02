step 0. x = 3.

step 1. x = 3 + 3 = 6.

step 2. loop 0: x = 6 + 1 = 7;
        loop 1: x = 7 + 1 = 8;
        loop 2: x = 8 + 1 = 9;
        loop 3: x = 9 + 1 = 10.

step 3. x = 3.

step 4. function doubleIt(3){
        return 6;

        doubleIt(3) = 6;
        6 is not assigned to x. 6 gets thrown out and x turns back to equalling 3.

        x = doubleIt(3);
        x = 6.
        (value is now assigned to x.)

step 5. loop 0: x = 6 + 0 = 6;
        loop 1: x = 6 + 1 = 7;
        loop 2: x = 7 + 2 = 9;
        loop 3: x = 9 + 3 = 12;

Answer is equal to 12.
